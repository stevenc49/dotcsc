# Introduction #

This is a school project. The objective of the project was to design and develop a prototype of a wireless RFID scanner, which could be used to scan book shelves with RFID embedded books. Allowing the user to search for books more easily and helps librarians manage inventory.

The source code contained in this SVN repository include the user web interface, the database scripts and the server code to communicate with the serial port (that's how the  antenna was connected)
