	* Port Scanning for the Modem is done automatically. The Gateway gets plugged in,
	and as soon as the installer gets turned on, the port scanner starts looking for
	the modem gateway. If the modem gateway is detected, the modem gets hooked to the
	broker and the broker start using SMS as a publisher.
	
	* The SMS Installer is a lot more stable now. It automatically checks into the list
	of bundles in the bundle context and detects which of the required functions for
	running SMS is already installed. It installs the ones that need to be installed and
	updates those that should be updated, and finally, starts those that need to starts.
	Things happen a lot more smoother for a user.
	
	* At the time of scanning ports, a progress bar is added to show what ports are being
	scanned and how many more ports are remained to be scanned.

	* A SMSInstaller bundle is added to the system that enables platform 
	specific installation of the SMS module and the required libraries. 
	
	* There is configuration file for the SMS module located in "configurations/services/" 
	that can be switched ON or OFF. If the switch is ON, the SMS modules and libraries will 
	be installed, if it is OFF, the module and the libraries will be uninstalled.

	* The connection timeout issue for DBCP is solved. The connections no
	longer get expired because of sitting idle in the pool for so long.
	
	* The synchronization issue with multiple objects trying to access the
	broker is solved. Using DBCP, each client is assigned its own
	Connection object to connect to the DB and thus there is no need to
	synchronize the connections.
	
	* The serial port for the SMS module can be configured using the
	properties file in the broker. The file is called
	"ca.ubc.magic.broker.publisher.service.sms.SMSPublisherDS.properties"
	
	* The configuration file for DBCP now can be configured to define the
	parameters for DBCP connection eviction and eviction idle time in the
	"ca.ubc.magic.osgibroker.storage.mysql.properties".

	* The broker now comes with the WebConsole module, enabling
	configuration of the broker to happen using the WebConsole without
	having to deal with the command line. The WebConsole is accessible
	from http://<your-host-name>:8800/system/console
