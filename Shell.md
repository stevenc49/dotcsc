# Introduction #

This is a UNIX Shell written for educational purposes. It is capable of transversing the directory tree with "cd", modify enviroment variables, and is able to fork a child process to run executables in its PATH.

I've tested this on my department's UNIX machines and on my Linux operating system (Debian - Ubuntu).
